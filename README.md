# 3. Structure of the Symbology

## Basic Symbols
The foundation of Universal Symbology lies in its basic symbols, each representing a fundamental concept or idea. These symbols are the building blocks of more complex representations and can be used individually or in combination to convey a wide range of meanings.

### Detailed Explanation of Each Basic Symbol
- **Point (•):** Represents a single unit, idea, or moment in time. It is the simplest form and the origin of all other symbols.
- **Line (—):** Symbolizes connection, direction, or progression. It can represent a path, relationship, or continuous flow.
- **Angle (∠):** Denotes divergence, change in direction, or intersection. It is often used to signify decision points or shifts.
- **Circle (○):** Represents wholeness, unity, or cycles. It can also symbolize containment, protection, or infinity.
- **Wave (∿):** Symbolizes fluctuation, movement, or energy. It is associated with concepts of flow, vibration, or change.
- **Curve (⌓):** Represents flexibility, adaptability, or gradual change. It is often used to signify growth, evolution, or transition.

### Usage Examples
- **Point:** A single decision or event in a timeline.
- **Line:** A direct path or connection between two points, such as a journey or process.
- **Angle:** A turning point in a strategy, where a change in direction is required.
- **Circle:** A project lifecycle, showing the iterative nature of development.
- **Wave:** Market trends that rise and fall over time.
- **Curve:** A learning curve representing gradual improvement.

## Complex Symbols and Combinations
While the basic symbols are powerful on their own, they can be combined to form more complex representations. These combinations allow for the expression of intricate ideas and relationships, making the symbology versatile and adaptable to various contexts.

### Explanation of How Symbols Can Be Combined
- **Point + Line (•—):** Represents a starting point and a journey or progression.
- **Line + Angle (—∠):** Indicates a direction followed by a change or decision point.
- **Circle + Wave (○∿):** Symbolizes cyclical change or the dynamic nature of a system.
- **Angle + Curve (∠⌓):** Represents a change that is gradual and adaptive, rather than abrupt.

### Examples of More Complex Symbology
- **Journey with Turning Points (•—∠—):** Represents a process that starts at a single point, progresses in a direction, encounters a decision point, and continues in a new direction.
- **Cyclical Flow (○∿○):** Illustrates a system that operates in cycles, with continuous fluctuations within each cycle.
- **Adaptive Evolution (∠⌓—⌓∠):** Depicts a process of change that is both directional and adaptable, allowing for growth and transition over time.
